# Download Node.js today

Download Node.js at <https://nodejs.org/en/download/> today! Compatible with Docker and a great addition to JavaScript to enhance your coding experience. If you don't download it, **none of the fabulous content that I'm making will be of any use to you!** (Quite a shame, in my opinion.)

## Run Node.js via regular command prompt (Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt)

To ensure that your Node.js file will run via regular you have to go to the Windows menu, and search up **"Environment Variables"**.
Click on **"Edit the system environment variables"**, then go to the bottom right, click on **"Environment variables"** and then click "New" in the **bottom-right!**
Then write *"PATH"* as the 'Variable name', and once you have downloaded Node.js, type "C:\Program Files\nodejs" in 'Variable value'. Then click 'Save' and close the window.
